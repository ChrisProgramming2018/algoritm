Find Closet Value in BST


You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes.
Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two
childeren left and right.

BST node := value is greater to every node to its left and less or equal to all
values to its right.

Childeren are BST nodes or None

You are given are target value. Write a function that finds the closest value in
the BST. Assume there will be only one closest value
